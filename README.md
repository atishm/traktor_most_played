# traktor_most_played
A script that parses your traktor history files to determine what tracks you played the most in a given year

### Prerequisites
This requires Python, basic cmd-line knowledge, and a directory full of Traktor histories. If you are a Traktor user, the histories are stored in your traktor root directory's History subfolder.
You can check your traktor root directory by opening Preferences->File Management in Traktor.

### Installing
No installation required, just run the script!

### Running
Here's an example of how I run this from my machine:
```
python most-played.py ~/Documents/Native\ Instruments/Traktor\ 2.11.0/History/
```
